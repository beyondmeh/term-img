# term-img

View images in a terminal.

## Requirements

Minimal, you probably already have most of these installed (maybe not PIL).

- *A terminal that supports...*
    - True color (24-bit / 16 million colors). [Most terminals](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728) support true color, but if you're unsure, run: `echo $COLORTERM`
    - Unicode as well as a Unicode font. At the least, you need the lower half block character: â–„ (U+2584)
- Python 3
- [Pillow / PIL](https://python-pillow.org) for Python 3 (`python3-pil` in Debian / Ubuntu). *Not to be confused with regular PIL for Python 2*
- tput
